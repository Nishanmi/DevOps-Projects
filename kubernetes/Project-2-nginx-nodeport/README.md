 Kubernetes Project 2: NGINX Deployment & NodePort Service

## Objective
Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with NGINX as a Deployment of 3 replicas and expose it using a NodePort service for external access.

## Tasks Performed
1. Used the existing Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes.
2. Created an NGINX Deployment with 3 replicas using `nginx-deployment.yaml`.
3. Created a NodePort Service using `nginx-nodeport.yaml` to expose NGINX externally.
4. Verified access to the NGINX page using the NodePort service on a browser.

## Deployment YAML Files
- [`nginx-deployment.yaml`](nginx-deployment.yaml)
- [`nodeport.yaml`](nodeport.yaml)
